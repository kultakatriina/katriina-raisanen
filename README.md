LUT University Front-End Course Project: Katriina R채is채nen, CV

Project Description

This project, created as part of the Front-End Development course at LUT University, 
showcases a personal website featuring my curriculum vitae (CV). It's designed to effectively 
highlight my educational background, work experience, skills, and projects undertaken throughout my career. 
The website's main objective is to provide a comprehensive and interactive overview of my professional journey, 
making it an ideal tool for potential employers and collaborators to gain insights into my expertise and skills.

The choice of technologies and design principles were affected by Brad Traversy's Youtube series "Responsive Portfolio Website Project".

Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges, and solving them strengthened my skills. 
Future enhancements are planned to keep the website up-to-date with new ideas and personal milestones.
